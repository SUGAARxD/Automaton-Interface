# Automaton-Interface
This program is a Graphical User Interface Application designed for the creation, simulation, and analysis of finite automaton, deterministic or nondeterministic. It provides an interactive way to visualize and understand the working of an automaton.

## Features
### State management
- *Add State*: Add a new state into the automaton.
- *Remove State*: Remove a state from the automaton with all the transitions that includes that state.
- *Initial State*: If checked, this will mark the clicked state as initial state. Only one initial state at a time.
- *Final State*: If checked, this will mark the clicked state as a final final.

### Transitions
- *Create Transitions*: Define transitions between states with specified input symbols by right clicking first state and then second state.
- *Create Lambda Transitions*: Define lambda(位) transitions between states by checking 位 Transition button and right clicking first state and then second state; this function appears only for an NFA 位.

### Automaton Management
- Gives the user the possibility to choose among different types of automatons like DFA, NFA and NFA 位.

### Word Processing 
- *Check Word*: Verifies input word if it's accepted by the automaton. It will display an animation of the word passing throw the automaton.
- *Check File Words*: Bulk verify words from a file if they are accepted by the automaton.
